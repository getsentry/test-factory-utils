# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active.
# To deactivate a plugin, comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply surround
# them with ${}. For strings the variable must be within quotes (ie, "${STR_VAR}"),
# for numbers and booleans they should be plain (ie, ${INT_VAR}, ${BOOL_VAR})

# Global tags can be specified here in key="value" format.
[global_tags]
# dc = "us-east-1" # will tag all metrics with dc=us-east-1
# rack = "1a"
## Environment variables can be used as tags, and throughout the config file
# user = "$USER"

# Configuration for telegraf agent
[agent]
## Default data collection interval for all inputs
interval = "10s"
## Rounds collection interval to 'interval'
## ie, if interval="10s" then always collect on :00, :10, :20, etc.
round_interval = true

## Telegraf will send metrics to outputs in batches of at most
## metric_batch_size metrics.
## This controls the size of writes that Telegraf sends to output plugins.
metric_batch_size = 1000

## Maximum number of unwritten metrics per output.  Increasing this value
## allows for longer periods of output downtime without dropping metrics at the
## cost of higher maximum memory usage.
metric_buffer_limit = 10000

## Collection jitter is used to jitter the collection by a random amount.
## Each plugin will sleep for a random time within jitter before collecting.
## This can be used to avoid many plugins querying things like sysfs at the
## same time, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
collection_jitter = "0s"

## Default flushing interval for all outputs. Maximum flush_interval will be
## flush_interval + flush_jitter
flush_interval = "10s"
## Jitter the flush interval by a random amount. This is primarily to avoid
## large write spikes for users running a large number of telegraf instances.
## ie, a jitter of 5s and interval 10s means flushes will happen every 10-15s
flush_jitter = "0s"

## By default or when set to "0s", precision will be set to the same
## timestamp order as the collection interval, with the maximum being 1s.
##   ie, when interval = "10s", precision will be "1s"
##       when interval = "250ms", precision will be "1ms"
## Precision will NOT be used for service inputs. It is up to each individual
## service input to set the timestamp at the appropriate precision.
## Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s".
precision = ""

## Log at debug level.
# debug = false
debug = true
## Log only error level messages.
# quiet = false

## Log target controls the destination for logs and can be one of "file",
## "stderr" or, on Windows, "eventlog".  When set to "file", the output file
## is determined by the "logfile" setting.
# logtarget = "file"

## Name of the file to be logged to when using the "file" logtarget.  If set to
## the empty string then logs are written to stderr.
# logfile = ""

## The logfile will be rotated after the time interval specified.  When set
## to 0 no time based rotation is performed.  Logs are rotated only when
## written to, if there is no log activity rotation may be delayed.
# logfile_rotation_interval = "0d"

## The logfile will be rotated when it becomes larger than the specified
## size.  When set to 0 no size based rotation is performed.
# logfile_rotation_max_size = "0MB"

## Maximum number of rotated archives to keep, any older logs are deleted.
## If set to -1, no archives are removed.
# logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5

## Pick a timezone to use when logging or type 'local' for local time.
## Example: America/Chicago
# log_with_timezone = ""

## Override default hostname, if empty use os.Hostname()
hostname = ""
## If set to true, do no set the "host" tag in the telegraf agent.
omit_hostname = false
