<!-- README.md is auto generated from README-template.md by calling ingest-mixed-generator with the `--update-docs` argument -->

`ingest-mixed-generator` is a tool that produces ingest messages on a Kafka topic comprising events, attachments, and user feedback. These messages are normally generated by Relay.

`ingest-mixed-generator` can be configured using a settings file (json or yaml) via the `-f` or `--settings-file` argument or directly through command line arguments.

**NOTE**: At this point, this generator creates messages that are structurally valid to pass through the ingest consumer. These messages neither emulate realistic traffic distributions, nor will they pass the processing pipeline or `save_event`.

The following arguments are available in the settings file:

```yaml
{settings_example}
```

The following arguments are available in the command line:

```
{cli_help}
```
